# Instructions

## Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## Generate a Github access token

To use the Github API you need to add an access token. You can do so here: https://github.com/settings/tokens

Note: It must be a "classic" token, and the token will destroy itself if you close down the development server, so you will need to re-generate as necessary.

Paste the token into the environment variable inside the `.env` file, overwriting the current value.

## Start the development server

Simply run:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Testing

Simply run:
```bash
npm run test
```

Thank you for taking the time to review this code.
